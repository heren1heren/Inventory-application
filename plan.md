WTD:

- # implementing view templates and routes handlers:
  **todo** implementing post http handlers
  total of 6 post routes handlers: create post -> delete post -> update post

Problems:
paths url need to be correctly designed to handle each id and create new stuff
why I cannot see virtual field of a model mogoose through console.log? : because virtual field is computed after console.log executed?

- can I dynamically paste url links to view template file? instead of hard code?
- populatedb file doesn't work.
  model structures:
  catagories model <-> items model by references: category

Extra Credits:
logging into a document named log.txt instead of the terminal
