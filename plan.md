WTD:

- implementing item_detail view
  -createing a paths.js that store each hard code path

- creating view templates

  - index view need mongodb count data
    - access mongodb count data

Problems:
paths url need to be correctly designed to handle each id and create new stuff
why I cannot see virtual field of a model mogoose through console.log? : because virtual field is computed after console.log executed?

- can I dynamically paste url links to view template file? instead of hard code?
- populatedb file doesn't work.
  model structures:
  catagories model <-> items model by references: category

Extra Credits:
logging into a document named log.txt instead of the terminal
